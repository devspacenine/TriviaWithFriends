{"answer":"Eight","difficulty":"3","question":"\t\r\n\r\nFree General Knowlege Quiz Questions\r\n\r\nThese are a few notes for getting started writing your pub quiz, or general knowledge quiz. There are no hard and fast rules. If you are just beginning and intending to do it on a regular basis, my advice would be to keep it simple, avoid controversy and test the water with the audience. Every pub has a different type of clientelle and what might be suitable at once end of town might be wholly unsuitable at the other!\r\n\r\nBeware when setting questions. The fatal mistake that question-writers often make is putting in questions which, although interesting facts in their own right, do not make good quiz questions.\r\n\r\nAn example of this might be \"Architecturally, what links Runcorn with Australia?\" The answer being that the Runcorn bridge and Syndey Harbour bridge are practically identical! It may be interesting but who is really going to know that? A very few people on Merseyside, perhaps? I once showed a picture of the Runcorn bridge and asked where the photo was taken, just for fun - Which is approaching it slightly different and it's a bit of fun. But if it's an obscure fact that people have little idea of knowing, they will not thank the quizmaster for it, even when the interesting nature of the answer is revealed!\r\n\r\nI find it is it good practise to have a mixture of quiz questions so that some are quite hardcore, requiring knowledge of fairly dry historical or scientific facts, combined with media or celbrity-based questions. Too much emphasis on either end of the spectrum will irk one type of quiz-goer.\r\n\r\nThe other type of question which it does no harm to throw in is one that requires some working out or at least a few moments thought. Asking how many property squares on a Monolopy board or the number of segments on a dart board are both good questions to lead to lively debate amonst team members, but should be far from impossible.\r\n\r\nThese are just a few thoughts on the way I put together a quiz and by no means a definitive guide. Every pub atmosphere is different and every set of participants is different. I find it is always important to listen to the feedback from teams. Whilst it is important to maintain some distance and attempt to keep some degree of authority for when the arguments break out, it is good to be able to take on board any criticism of style of question and you will soon learn what to avoid.\r\n\r\nA final word of advice though - It is always the negaive people who are the loudest. A single team of moaners who don't like football questions will always create a greater impression on you than the other half dozen teams who got those questions right and go home happy with the quiz. Take it as a complement when teams return and don't listen too hard to the moaners! They will no doubt have finished near the bottom of the of the pile, while the teams that do well on quiz night don't say a word but no doubt appreciate your effort!\r\n\r\nIn the U.S.A. , what is celebrated on February 2nd and is also a film? GROUNDHOG DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn what profession would you use the acronym \"SOCO\"? Police Work Scene of Crime Officers\r\n\r\nWhat is the official national anthem of the USA.? (Star Spangled Banner)\r\n\r\nThe blue cornflower is the French equivalent to what in England? Red Poppy\r\n\r\nWhich weather phenomenon translates from the Spanish for 'little boy'. (EL NINO)\r\n\r\nAmbassador to the Court of Saint James is the official title for Ambassadors of which country? UK\r\n\r\nWhich castle is on the island of Anglesey? Beaumaris\r\n\r\nWhat is echolalia? Involuntary Speech repetition, Navigation by sound, Anxiety caused by your own voice\r\n\r\nWhich N. African seaport's name is Spanish for white house?
